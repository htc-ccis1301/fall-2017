## Site Design Contract
To get full credit for your portfolio project, you must submit wireframes that show how you intend to design your site in advance. These should be created up-front, before you actually build your website, as this is a tool for *design* and planning. This allows gives me a way to visualize your plans for your site so that I can see that they meet the project requirements.

Failure to submit the wireframes will result in a 30% reduction in your overall final project grade, and may also result in a lower overall project score as your site design may fail to meet the requirements of the  project.

Once you submit your wireframes, you will need to discuss any potential changes with me and have any changes approved before making changes to your site design.  If this is not done, points may be deducted for not fulfilling the design contract established with the wireframes."

## Grading
This assignment is worth 30 points and will be graded as follows:

- Mobile design - 10 points
- Tablet design - 10 points
- Desktop design - 10 points

Each design layout should reflect the use of the required Bootstrap components and make good use of the available space.  Remember to apply the 60-30-10 rule and good web design best practices.

## Wireframes
For this first part of the assignment, you will sketch out your site in a wireframe.  You may use whatever tool you like for this, including pen/paper, but you must submit the completed wireframes to the assignment box on D2L.  (Make good scans or photos if you use pen/paper.)  There are several specialized tools you could try for free, or you can use tools like PowerPoint or Visio.

### Level of Detail
You should place headings on the page so that it is clear that you are including all sections and in what order they will be presented.  

Other content can be outlined with horizontal or wavy lines to indicate blocks of text. I do not need to see the exact *text*, but should be able to see where it will be located and how it will be formatted. Fore example, a paragraph should look different than a bullet or numbered list, centered content should be distinguishable from left or right aligned content.

Boxes with an X through them are often used to show where images will be placed, and can also be used to indicate borders and sections of content.

### Design
Make sure to consider what you have learned about the look and feel of Bootstrap in the creation of your wireframes. The more you try to alter their standard components display the harder this project will be.  In particular, make sure to allow for how their nav bar will display in the design of your site's navigation and header.

You must include a wireframe showing the mobile view, a tablet view and a desktop view. Make sure that you are considering the display width for your presentation on each device, and alter the layout appropriately for the display size.  For example on a desktop, fixed width content with large open margins on the sides makes sense, but you would want those margins to hide on a mobile device.

### Side by Side content
As seen with Ms B's Veggies, the Bootstrap grid can easily be used to side-by-side content. You should utilize this effectively to make good use of the extra width available on a wide-screen desktop display.  There are many options for how to do this, but __DO NOT__ side-by-side completely different sections such as "Skills" & "Education" which have separate links on the navigation bar. This can make it unclear that the link went to the correct location, and may be confusing to site visitors.  (Poor usability.)

If you must side-by-side different sections, then the heading and navigation for that section should change on the desktop display. For example on a mobile device you might have two nav links and headings, "Skills" and "Education", and then on a desktop device you might hide those two separate headings and instead show a combined "Skills & Education" nav link and heading.

Generally speaking however, most sites that attempt to combine separate sections in this manner end up looking squished and cluttered.  Often the extra space is better used to add optional images, or side-by-side content within the same sections such as putting multiple "Skills" lists side-by-side to eliminate vertical scrolling.

## Submit for Feedback
To submit your wireframes you will need to submit them electronically to the assignment box on D2L. Please clearly name them to reflect the device size. You should have 3 submissions, one for mobile, one for tablet and one for desktop.  It is important that you read and follow up on the wireframe feedback. If your design is unclear or has problems, you will be asked to resubmit updated wireframes within a few days.

The assignment box will remain open throughout the project to allow for wireframe updates, but after initial feedback is given, you should discuss any changes with me before making them. It is not acceptable to just decide at the last minute to alter the design because you couldn't get it to work right. Differences between the wireframe design and the final design will result in a lower final score.
