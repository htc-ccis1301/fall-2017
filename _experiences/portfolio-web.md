## Grading
This assignment is worth 70 points and will be graded as follows:

- All HTML and CSS files are valid - 10 points (all or nothing)
- Mobile , tablet & desktop layout (matches wireframes) - 15 points
- Custom CSS (colors, fonts, margins, padding, etc.) - 5 points
- Required personalize information including IT skills & education - 5 points
- Portfolio Gallery - 10 points
- Bootstrap Navbar and ScrollSpy used with links to HTML5 articles/sections - 10 points
- Use of Bootstrap Grid - 5 points
- Appropriate use of Bootstrap CSS and/or other Bootstrap components- 5 points
- Use of Icon Font (Font Awesome or Bootstrap Glypicons) & Link to Paletton Color Palette - 5 points


## Custom Style
Utilize the resources available to you to select a custom color palette, fonts and icons.  Use [Paletton](http://paletton.com/) or a similar site to make a color palette and add a link to that in your footer.  Use [CSS Font Stack](http://www.cssfontstack.com/) to browse and select one or two fonts, setting up appropriate font family properties to ensure good fallback fonts. Optionally use custom bullets with images or icons from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) or [Bootstrap Glypicons](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).

I would recommend that you take the same approach that we used to customize Ms. B's Veggies, and set up your own stylesheet to add and alter styles as needed.  While it is possible to [customize Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) for download, this process for this can be a little overwhelming and time intensive, especially while you are still finalizing your choices.


## Feedback & Polish
Make sure that you've acted on any feedback received earlier, as a failure to do so will likely result in a lower overall score.  Ensure your main page looks polished, professional and complete. Make sure to proof-read carefully, and then have someone else proof read for you.

__This is intended to be your online resume, spelling, grammar, and punctuation all make an impression.  Make sure it will be a good one.__


## Test & Validate
Check your page locally (on your computer) by viewing it in the browser, paying particular attention to any differences intended between the mobile, tablet, and desktop presentation.  Verify that all of your navigation links work and that your headings are not hidden under the nav bar.  Check that your site matches your wireframes.  Remember that is our design contract.

Make sure that you have included all of the required content!

Test validate, then test and validate again just to be sure it's all great.  This is your final chance to review the site before submitting it for your final grade.  Once you have verified your work, version and push it up to GitHub.  


### Publish to the web
Once your changes are on GitHub, create a pull-request to move the changes from the __master__ branch to the __gh-pages__ branch. After creating the pull-request and reviewing the changes, merge the changes to publish your work to the web.  Make sure to repeat your testing and validation using the published web site.


## Submit the assignment
When everything looks good, create the pull request for the grading branch to have your work graded. Remember, __DO NOT MERGE__ this pull request. For the work to be graded, the pull-request must be left open.  

Submit the following screenshots to the Assignment box on D2L:

- Open-pull request
- Actual web page as published on GitHub (URL in Settings)
- Validation of HTML & CSS files by URL. (You are not responsible for the Bootstrap CSS only your own.)


 Now it's time to celebrate! You're all done!  :dancer:
