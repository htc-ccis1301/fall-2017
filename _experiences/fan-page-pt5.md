## Prerequisites
Completion of this exercise requires completion of the previous assignments:  

- [Fan Page - Part 1]({{ "/experiences/fan-page-pt1.html " | prepend: site.baseurl }})
- [Fan Page - Part 2]({{ "/experiences/fan-page-pt2.html " | prepend: site.baseurl }})
- [Fan Page - Part 3]({{ "/experiences/fan-page-pt3.html " | prepend: site.baseurl }})
- [Fan Page - Part 4]({{ "/experiences/fan-page-pt4.html " | prepend: site.baseurl }})


## Continue the assignment
Since this is a multi-part assignment, you will continue working with the website and repository from the previous part.

You should see your repository from the previous assignment here:
[ {{ site.data.github-info.org-name }} ]( {{ site.data.github-info.org-url }} )

If you did not complete the earlier parts of the assignment, you will need to go back and do that before beginning this assignment. There is a link to the earlier assignments in the Prerequisites section above.

## Requirements
For this assignment the requirement is simple: clean-up the page such that it is in a state that you would show it to others as an illustration of your HTML & CSS skills.  

Anything that you have been required to add to the page previously and do not want, you can take away or change. However, you should maintain enough content that you illustrate basic HTML & CSS features.  For example, you'll want to retain headings and navigation. You should also ensure that your page displays well on different devices sizes.

Apply a well designed color palette (if you haven't already) using a site such as [Paleton](http://paletton.com/) so that things look professional.


### Publish to the web
Once your changes are on GitHub, create a pull-request to move the changes from the __dev__ branch to the __gh-pages__ branch. After creating the pull-request and reviewing the changes, merge the changes to publish your work to the web.  Make sure to repeat your testing and validation using the published web site.


## Submit the assignment
When everything looks good, create the pull request for the grading branch to have your work graded. Remember, __DO NOT MERGE__ this pull request. For the work to be graded, the pull-request must be left open.  

Submit the following screenshots (in one MS Word document) to the Assignment box on D2L:

- The Open pull-request for the __grading__ branch
- The actual web page as published on GitHub Pages (URL in Settings)
- Validation of HTML file using the W3C Validator
- Validation of CSS file

You __must__ capture URL at the top of the browser display and the page contents for the screenshots.

You can continue working on the Fan Page assignment locally and push updates to the __dev__ branch, but please do not merge any changes to __gh-pages__ until the previous work for the assignment has been graded. I will aim to have feedback to you within a few days of your submission, so you won't have to wait long.
