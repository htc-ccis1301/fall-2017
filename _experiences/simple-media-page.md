## Prerequisites
To successfully complete this assignment, you should be familiar with basic concepts of responsive design and how to make in page links to content.  This is reviewed in the reading for this module:
- [Multimedia on the Web]( {{ site.baseurl }}/readings/media.html )
- [Custon Fonts & Icons]( {{ site.baseurl }}/readings/fonts-icons )

## Overview
For this assignment, you will make a web page that uses different types of media files.

{% include alert.html type="tip"
    content="Make sure to credit creators when using content that belongs to others. I expect that you will only use content from others with permission and include appropriate acknowledgements when doing so."
%}

## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [simple-media]( https://classroom.github.com/a/JGwA4mKQ ).

The repository contains the standard Readme.md and .gitignore files and empty index.html & style.css files.  Please update the existing files with your HTML & CSS.


## Requirements
Create a web page that demonstrates your ability to include multimedia files on your website. The web page should include:

- HTML5 structure tags for header, nav, main, footer, and article/sections as appropriate
- basic CSS for styling, ensure good presentation with adequate spacing
- a short audio or video or clip (preferably one you make yourself) with a link to download
- an iframe with a youtube video
- Use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to add icons for social media (minimum GitHub & LinkedIn) to the footer of your page.  These icons should link to your account. (If you do not have a LinkedIn account, I recommend that you set one up as it is an excellent career tool, but you may instead link to their main page if you do not have an account.)
- Find a non-standard font and include and use it on your page using CSS @font-face

{% include alert.html type="warning"
    content="Be careful with your encoding for audio and video that you record yourself. As noted in the reading, the encoding can cause problems if not supported by the web browser. Make sure to use a type supported by Chrome."
%}


## Testing
Once you are happy with your work, push it up to GitHub.  Make sure to check the display of your page live on GitHub Pages and re-validate your page by URL.


## Submit
Create a pull-request and submit the following screenshots to the Assignment box on D2L:

- Open-pull request
- Actual web page as published on GitHub (URL in Settings)
- Validation of HTML file
- Validation of CSS file

You __must__ capture both the validator URL and the validator output in the validation screenshots.
