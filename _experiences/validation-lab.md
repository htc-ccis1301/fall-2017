## Prerequisites
Completion of this exercise requires an understanding of the material from earlier modules and from:

- [HTML Validation]({{ "/readings/intro-valid-html.html " | prepend: site.baseurl }})


## GitHub Project

[Assignment: Validation Lab]( https://classroom.github.com/a/MTBjx8K4 )


## Fix the Validation Errors
Open the repository folder in Brackets. (Remember to use Open Folder, not Open which opens only a single file.)

Take a look at the index.html page, *but* even if you see things that are incorrect __DO NOT__ fix them yet. Part of the point of this lab is to expose you to different messages that might be harder to spot later on.

Use the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate the index.html page using the File Upload feature.

Beginning with the first error shown, correct the error and then revalidate the page.  Often correcting one error will eliminate others.  

Try not to correct other errors you might see yet, so that you have the experience of seeing and fixing each of the errors I've planted for you.  By correcting one error at a time, at least for this lab, it will help you to learn the meaning of some of the less than clear error messages that can come from validating your pages.

Once all of the errors are correct, test the display of the page.  It should display with a main heading and two subheadings each with a paragraph of text underneath.  Once you have verified your work, version and push it up to GitHub.  


### Publish to the web
Once your changes are on GitHub, create a pull-request to move the changes from the __dev__ branch to the __gh-pages__ branch. After creating the pull-request and reviewing the changes, merge the changes to publish your work to the web.  Make sure to repeat your testing and validation using the published web site.


### Submit for grading
When you are ready to submit you work, create the pull-request for grading. Remember, __DO NOT MERGE__ this pull request. For the work to be graded, the pull-request must be left open.  Make sure to take a screenshot of the open pull-request to put in the assignment box on D2L.
