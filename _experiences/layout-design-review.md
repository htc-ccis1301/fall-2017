## Prerequisites
The following topic was covered earlier:

- [Page Layout & Design]({{ "/readings/design-layout.html " | prepend: site.baseurl }})


## Requirements
For this assignment, you will examine a series of internet sites and discuss their page layout. Select your two favorite site layouts from the following list of websites to compare and contrast in your writing.

1. [Google One Today Projects](https://onetoday.google.com/home/projects)
2. [Zomato Twin Cities](https://www.zomato.com/twin-cities)
3. [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/)
4. [Science Friday](http://www.sciencefriday.com/)
5. [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/)

Many of these sites have a long scrolling page.  Make sure to scroll down to include the full page layout in your diagram. Note that if sections of blocks repeat, you can include 2-3 rows and note that they repeat instead of drawing the same blocks repeatedly.  However, make sure to scroll to the bottom and include any footer or end content of the page in your diagram.

### Design Comparison
Write a short (500-750 word) paper (MS Word document) to discuss the two site designs you selected as your favorites.

Write a short introduction indicating the two sites you have chosen and the purpose of the paper.

For each site, summarize their design, including alterations made for different device sizes, and discuss why you selected this site as one of your favorites.  Indicate if their layout matches a pattern from the reading. Include screenshots to illustrate, adjusting the width of your browser window to simulate the display for tablet or phone. As the display narrows, the layout will shift.

Conclude the paper by comparing and contrasting the two different designs, reiterating why you selected these as your favorites.

## Submit
When complete, upload your MS Word document containing the screenshots, diagrams and discussion to the Assignment box in D2L.
