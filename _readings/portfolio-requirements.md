# {{ page.title }}
This final project is intended to show everything that you have learned over the course. It is a large part of your final grade for this course. A failure to complete the project will result in a large drop in your final grade for the course. (See the course syllabus for details.)  

I also encourage you to maintain this website and use it as an online resume or portfolio as you begin looking for a job.  It is strongly recommended that you continue to use GitHub as a repository for all of your course content so that you can link to this work on your portfolio and resume.  Having an active GitHub profile that shows what you are learning and what you know can be a huge asset in your future job search.


## Overview
Think of this portfolio as your online resume. The site will be made using Bootstrap, using the principles of mobile first design.  Plan first how this will look on a phone (never know who you'll bump into at a coffee shop) and then enhance it for a desktop. Bootstrap will help you to do this as it is "mobile first".

You are free to customize the look of the site to suit your own taste and style, and in fact is it is meant to showcase your style and personality. No two of these final projects should look alike. However, you must include the information discussed below.

Make yourself a checklist and double-check your site content against this list as your complete each phase of the project so that you do not miss anything along the way.


## Site Requirements
The site must contain all of the information below __on a *single* web page__.  If you wish to include additional pages with additional supporting information, you can do that. However I must be able to find all of the key information below on the main page and each section of content must have an in-page link in the main navbar.

### Required Content
Your site __must__ include the following content:

- Your full name
- A short intro or personal statement (No more than 3 sentences. who are you, what kind of job do you want, etc)
- A professional looking picture of yourself (They say it helps leave a good impression)
- Link to your GitHub profile using one of Font Awesome's icons for GitHub.
- Same page navigation links to each of the following sections:
  - A section for Skills.  This should include both technical skills (at the very least you can use a computer and know HTML5/CSS and Bootstrap) and soft skills.
  - A section for Projects (see below)
  - A section for Education (include school(s), degree(s)/program(s) and a list of relevant courses)
- Footer w/ copyright, link to a Paletton color scheme, and optionally an email.

You may optionally also include the following:

- Section for Work/Volunteer Experience
- Additional Social Media Links (LinkedIn is a good choice, add others only if you consider the content there to be professional)

#### Project Section
The project section must include a gallery featuring your class projects.  At a minimum you should include 3 separate projects from this course - your fan page, Ms B's Veggies, and one or more other projects of your choosing.  You are also welcome to add course work from other classes that you have added to GitHub.  

Each HTML project should have an image screenshot that links to the project's live web page hosted on GitHub. There should also be an image caption that links to the GitHub repository *code* page. (This is the page that shows all the files in the repository.)  

For any non-HTML projects you might choose to include from other courses, you may either:
- list them with the HTML content above, but with a screenshot image that is not a link, just have the  caption text link to GitHub
- list them separately as just text link to your GitHub repositories


### Required Bootstrap components
You __must__ use the following Bootstrap components when creating your portfolio site:

- [Navbar](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) - with links to each required section
- [ScrollSpy](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy)
- [Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) - used for responsive site layout instead of custom media queries

As you are designing the look and feel of your site, you will want to consider how these components will effect the layout and display of your website.  This is discussed further in the Wireframe assignment.

### Custom CSS
You do not want your site to look exactly like a default, black & white, Bootstrap website. Utilize the resources available to you to select a custom color palette, fonts and icons. Add a custom CSS file to the site to add your own CSS and to override the Bootstrap CSS when needed to tailor and personalize your site design.

- __Colors:__ Use Paletton or a similar tool or site to design a color palette for your page. Choose a color scheme that is professional, but interesting. Even small amounts of color will help to make your page stand out.

- __Fonts:__ Use CSS Font Stack to browse and select one or two fonts, setting up appropriate font family properties to ensure good fallback fonts. I will specifically be looking for the use of complete font stacks for robust browser support.

- __Lists:__ You might also choose to use images or icons from Font Awesome or Bootstrap Glypicons as custom bullets for any lists on your page.

To customize Bootstrap components, it is recommended that you simply override the Bootstrap CSS in your own custom CSS file. (This is the approach taken in the Ms. Bâ€™s Veggies assignment.) This will allow you to customize your design while showing that you understand the CSS Cascade and how to override CSS.

While it is possible to customize Bootstrap for download, this process for this can be a little overwhelming and time intensive for this type of small project and is NOT expected.

## Project Submission
The project is broken up into three parts:

- Wireframe design & feedback
- In-Progress Review: HTML outline (optional)
- Final site submission

The due dates for each part are on the assignment boxes on D2L.  

Make sure to get started on the work early.  Many students underestimate the effort required for this project.
