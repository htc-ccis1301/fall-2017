## Responsive Design
A responsive or fluid design is one that adjusts itself to the available view space. The idea has become pretty much standard now with the popularity of both mobile phones and wide-screen monitors. As you might imagine, if a site designed for a small, narrow mobile phone is seen on a wide-screen desktop, it will look very different (and very likely not very good). Likewise, a site designed for that wide-screen desktop might be squished or require a lot of scrolling if viewed on a phone.

As the range of view sizes grew, so did the need to accommodate that variation in a standard, yet flexible way. Thus responsive design was born, and continues to grow and evolve today. In this module, we will use media queries to allow for a responsive or fluid design. Yet you should be aware that newer techniques (flexbox & grid) are also out there, though they are not yet as stable or widely supported.
